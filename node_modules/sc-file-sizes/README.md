# sc-file-sizes

Outputs a YAML file with the sizes of the gzipped and minified CSS and JS for our ads

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev sc-file-sizes
```

## Usage

Here's a simple use case - see the Platform's gulpfile for how we're using it (minification is handled separately as part of a parent gulp task).  Note that you can pass it a path, or it will write to config/file_sizes.yml:

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var filesizes = require('sc-file-sizes');

gulp.task('filesizes', function () {
	return gulp.src('./dist/*')
		.pipe(filesizes({path: 'path/to/file.yml'}));
});
```
